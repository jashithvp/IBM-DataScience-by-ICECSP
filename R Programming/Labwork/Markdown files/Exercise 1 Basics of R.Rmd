# Exercise 1. Basics of R

<br>  

<b>Estimated time: </b>  
45 Minutes 

<b>What this exercise is about</b>  
We will test you on a few topics  

* Basic Data Types   
* Basic Arithmetic   
* Vector   
* Vector Operations   
* Comparison operators     
* Vector Selection and Indexing  

<b>
Requirernents:</b> RStudio 
  
<b>Solve the following problerns using R
</b>

Q1. What is two to the Of five? 
```{r}
5^2
```
<br>
Q2. Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21.34.
```{r}
stoke.prices <-c(23,27,23,21,34)
```
<br>
Q3. Find the mean Of stock.prices
```{r}
mean(stoke.prices)
```
<br>
Q4. Find the Standard deviation for the stock.prices
```{r}
sd(stoke.prices)
```
<br>
Q5. Find the sum for the stock.prices
```{r}
sd(stoke.prices)
```
<br>
Q6. Assign names to the price data points relating to the day Of the week, starting With Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.
```{r}
names(stoke.prices) <- c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thurs","Fri")
```
<br>
Q7. What was the average (mean) stock price for the week? (You may need to reference a built-in function) 
```{r}
mean(stoke.prices)
```
<br>
Q8. Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to the days where the stock price was more than $23
```{r}
over.23 <- stoke.prices >23
```
<br>
Q9. Use the over23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day and prices where the price was over $23.
```{r}
stoke.prices[over.23]
```
<br>
Q10. Use a built-in function to find the day the price was the highest?
```{r}
max(stoke.prices)
```
<br>
Q11. Create a variable named var and store the value "Welcome" on it?
```{r}
var <- "Welcome"
```
<br>
Q12. Check the datatype of var?
```{r}
class(var)
```
<br>
Q13. What is console Window?  
The console window (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where R is waiting for you to tell it what to do, and where it will show the results of a command. You can type commands directly into the console, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.  
<br>
Q14. HOW many packages are there in R?  
There are now more than 10,000 R packages available for download.  
<br>
Q15. What is the full form Of CRAN?    
Comprehensive R Archive Network

<br>
Q16. What is the difference between data types and data structures in R?  
R has 6 basic data types. (In addition to the five listed below, there is also raw which will not be discussed in this workshop.)  

* character
* numeric (real or decimal)
* integer
* logical
* complex

Elements of these data types may be combined to form data structures, such as atomic vectors. When we call a vector atomic, we mean that the vector only holds data of a single data type. Below are examples of atomic character vectors, numeric vectors, integer vectors, etc.  

* character: "a", "swc"
* numeric: 2, 15.5
* integer: 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)
* logical: TRUE, FALSE
* complex: 1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

<br>
Q17. What is the difference R and RStudio?  
It is important to note the differences between R and RStudio. R is a programming language used for statistical computing while RStudio uses the R language to develop statistical programs. In R, you can write a program and run the code independently of any other computer program.
